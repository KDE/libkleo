/** @brief A dialog to show for encryption / signing key approval or selection.
 *
 * This class is intended to replace the old KeyApprovalDialog with a new
 * and simpler interface.
 *
 * Resolved recipients in this API means a recipient could be resolved
 * to a single useful key. An unresolved recipient is a recipient for
 * whom no key could be found. Import / Search will be offered for such
 * a recipient. Multiple keys for signing / recipient can come e.g. from
 * group configuration or Addressbook / Identity configuration.
 *
 * The Dialog uses the Level System for validity display and shows an
 * overall outgoing level.
