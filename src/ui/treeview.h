/**
 * A tree view that allows accessible column by column keyboard navigation
 * and that has customizable columns through a context menu in the header.
 *
 * Column by column navigation is required to make a tree view accessible.
 *
 * The TreeView allows column by column keyboard navigation even if
 * the selection behavior is set to SelectRows and users can expand/collapse
 * list items. To achieve this it deactivates the standard behavior of QTreeView
 * to expand/collapse items if the left/right arrow keys are used.
 *
 * Additionally, you may want to disable parent-child navigation in tree views
 * with left/right arrow keys because this also interferes with column by column
 * navigation. You can do this by setting
 * "QTreeView { arrow-keys-navigate-into-children: 0; }"
 * as application style sheet.
