/**
 * Class to find Keys for E-Mail signing and encryption.
 *
 * The KeyResolver uses the Keycache to find keys for signing
 * or encryption.
 *
 * Overrides can be provided for address book integration.
 *
 * If no override key(s) are provided for an address and no
 * KeyGroup for this address is found, then the key
 * with a uid that matches the address and has the highest
 * validity is used. If both keys have the same validity,
 * then the key with the newest subkey is used.
 *
 * The KeyResolver also supports groups so the number of
 * encryption keys does not necessarily
 * need to match the amount of sender addresses. For this reason
 * maps are used to map addresses to lists of keys.
 *
 * The keys can be OpenPGP keys and S/MIME (CMS) keys.
 * As a caller you need to partition the keys by their protocol and
 * send one message for each protocol for the recipients and signed
 * by the signing keys.
